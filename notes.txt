Q: What to cache
1. The CRUD operations should only be cached
    Create: -> save(), create()
    read: -> find(), findOne(), findById()
    update: -> updateOne, updateMany, findByIdAndUpdate, findByIdAndReplace
    delete: -> similar

Q: Check if Query object contains info about mongo middleware

Q: Also current chaining cache queries doesn't work with callback

APIs:

model.prototype.save()

middleware implementation
pros -> can cache the output of complete query, 
cons -> The data may become useless for any other query, Cannot perform update or delete, since the query cannot be identified

Wrapper implementation
pros -> only cache reusable data i.e as stored in db
cons -> Make it chainable, by conveting data to query object
